Your pull request **will not** be merged if:
- You already own a subdomain on our service.
- The records provided includes invalid/unpermitted record types. If this happens we will notify you and request changes.
- It violates users privacy.
- It uses Netlify, as there are issues with subdomain verification. We hope to add support back soon.
- The domain is not being used for a valid website/blog/portfolio/api application. This is reviewed on a case by case basis.

*If your subdomain is inactive, it may be purged. We will try and notify you before purging via the email you provided.*
